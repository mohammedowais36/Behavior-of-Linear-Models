# Behavior-of-Linear-Models
A linear model is an equation that describes a relationship between two quantities that show a constant rate of change. They can be trained relatively quickly and are generally more straightforward to interpret. This project involves in observing how linear models work in case of data imbalanced, and how hyper plane changes according to change in learning rate for both svm and logistic regression. We have created 4 random datasets which are linearly separable and having class imbalance. We will also observe how linear models work in case of data having feautres with different variance. And last but not least we will be working the regression problem and how regularization helps to get rid of outliers, and we will see how the hyperplane is changing in presence of outliers. For each regularizer: for each outlier: add the outlier to the data fit the linear regression to the updated data get the hyper plane plot the hyperplane along with the data points
